# Grow Your Own (PlantsApp)
##### Inspired by my friends lounge-cross-jungle

Inspired by my friends lounge/jungle, I wanted to really produce an app that would work across mobile & web that would allow people to be able to water their own virtual-plants.

Sockets.io, I wanted to intergrate a MongoDB database that would keep track of users, I didn't want a complicated sign up procedure, I wanted people to be able to pickup and use the app just based on their username alone as the login.

Api Calls/REST/CRUD. I really wanted to have a different way of dealing with the growth of the plants, to do this I implemented sockets to work with the MongoDB database inside the Node.js backend.

Angular 1.49 provided the opportunity to do live changes on the frontend providing the user feedback on the changes they made as they interacted with the plants and instantly see these changes reflected in the DOM. 

I wanted to use a DROP & Drag type functionality, to achieve this I used NG-Draggable.

The App is currently not completed, I am working towards this but currently am working full time and occassional sideprojects etc are getting in the way.

To see the Heroku Deployment & the current state of the app please use the link
